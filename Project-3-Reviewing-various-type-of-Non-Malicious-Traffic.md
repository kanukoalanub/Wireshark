# Reviewing various type of Non Malicious Traffic

## Introduction
This project covers what non-malicious and normal traffic looks like. we shall also review various types of non-malicious activity that security professionals may run across when checking packet capture (pcaps) of network traffic. This includes operating system traffic, traffic generated by web browsers, application updates, IRC traffic, FTP traffic, email traffic, and file transfers over SMB and Tor traffic.

## Lab Set-up and Tools

1. **Tool**: Wireshark v4.2.6
2. **Sample PCAP File**: Download a sample PCAP file containing malware traffic for analysis.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Investigate possible windows malware alert to confirm if its actually a Windows malware alert.

#### Steps

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Go to "File" > "Open" and select the sample PCAP file you downloaded.
3. The file will load, and the captured traffic will be displayed. lets use basic filter.
4. when we verify the domains and URLs that indicate this host is running fedora linux.
5. The alert shows a port 55358, we will find this port in column display and follow TCP stream.

#### Expected Output

6. The user-agent line in the HTTP Headers also shows that the host is using Fedora, Linux.

### Exercise 2: Verify the Traffic caused by Web Browsers

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Go to "File" > "Open" and select the sample PCAP file you downloaded.
3. The file will load, and the captured traffic will be displayed.
4. **updates for Google chrome and chromium based Microsoft Edge** generate traffic to domains ending in .gvt1.com

#### Expected Output
5. please find the screen shot below for theTraffic generated by Google chrome
