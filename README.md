# Wireshark-projects

## Overview

This repository contains five beginner-level projects focused on using Wireshark for security forensics and investigation. Each project provides essential techniques for capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify potential security issues and improve network performance.

## Projects

### 1. [Analyzing HTTP Traffic with Wireshark](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-1-Analyzing-HTTP-Traffic-with-Wireshark.md) 

This project covers how to capture and analyze HTTP traffic using Wireshark. And also setting up captures, filtering HTTP traffic, analyzing HTTP requests and responses, and extracting payload data.

* Key Topics: HTTP Traffic, Packet Analysis, Filtering, Payload Extraction
* Tools: Wireshark, Web Browser

### 2. [Investigate Network Traffic from Windows based Malware Infections](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-2-Investigate-Network-Traffic-from-Windows-based-Malware-Infections.md) 

This project covers how to use Wireshark to investigate network traffic from Windows based malware infections.

* Key Topics: Malware Infections, Network Traffic Analysis -DHCP, NBNS.
* Reporting Tools: Wireshark, Sample PCAP Files

### 3. [Reviewing Various types of Non-Malicious Traffic](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-3-Various-types-of-Non-Malicious-Traffic.md)

This project covers what non-malicious and normal traffic looks like. Routine web browsing, operating system activity from Microsoft Windows, and legitimate applications can generate unusual traffic if you have never seen it before. 

we shall also review various types of non-malicious activity that security professionals may run across when checking packet capture (pcaps) of network traffic. This includes operating system traffic, traffic generated by web browsers, application updates, IRC traffic, FTP traffic, email traffic, and file transfers over SMB and Tor traffic.

* Key Topics: Non-Malicioius Traffic Vs Normal Traffic, OS Traffic, Traffic generated by Web browsers, Application updates, IRC traffic, FTP traffic, email traffic, file transfers over SMB and Tor traffic.
* Tools: Wireshark, Sample PCAP Files

### 4. [Decrypting Analyzing SSL/TLS Traffic](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-4-Decrypting-Analyzing-TLS-Traffic.md)

Master the process of decrypting and analyzing SSL/TLS traffic with Wireshark. This project includes configuring decryption settings, filtering SSL/TLS traffic, analyzing decrypted packets, and following secure communication streams.

*  Key Topics: SSL/TLS Decryption, Secure Traffic Analysis, Filtering, Communication Streams
*  Tools: Wireshark, Private Key Files, Sample PCAP Files

### 5. [Capturing and Analyzing VOIP Traffic](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-5-Capturing-and-Analyzing-VOIP-Traffic.md)

Capture and analyze VoIP traffic using Wireshark. This project covers capturing VoIP calls, filtering SIP and RTP traffic, analyzing SIP packets, examining RTP streams, and playing back VoIP call audio.

* Key Topics: VoIP Traffic, SIP, RTP, Call Analysis, Playback
* Tools: Wireshark, VoIP Network or Sample PCAP Files
