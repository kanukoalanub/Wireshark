# Wireshark-projects

## Overview

This repository contains five beginner-level projects focused on using Wireshark for security forensics and investigation. Each project provides essential techniques for capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify potential security issues and improve network performance.

## Projects

### 1. [Analyzing HTTP Traffic with Wireshark](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-1-Analyzing-HTTP-Traffic-with-Wireshark.md) 

This project covers how to capture and analyze HTTP traffic using Wireshark. And also setting up captures, filtering HTTP traffic, analyzing HTTP requests and responses, and extracting payload data.

* Key Topics: HTTP Traffic, Packet Analysis, Filtering, Payload Extraction
* Tools: Wireshark, Web Browser

### 2. [Investigate Network Traffic from Windows based Malware Infections](https://github.com/kanukoalanub/Wireshark-projects/blob/main/Project-2-Investigate-Network-Traffic-from-Windows-based-Malware-Infections.md) 

This project covers how to use Wireshark to investigate network traffic from Windows based malware infections.
